Titanic Survival Prediction

This is a machine learning project that uses various algorithms to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic will survive or not. The data set used in this project contains information about the passengers such as their age, gender, class, etc.

Prerequisites

Before running this project, make sure that you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas (For working with data frames)

numpy (For numerical computing)

seaborn (For data visualization)

matplotlib (For creating plots and graphs)

sklearn (For machine learning algorithms)


Usage

Open Jupyter Notebook or any other Python IDE.

Import the necessary libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and sklearn.

Load the Titanic dataset into the program.

Perform data analysis and wrangling to clean and transform the data into a usable format.

Use various machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Perceptron, Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier to train the model.

Test the accuracy of the model on a separate testing dataset.

Finally, use the model to predict whether a new passenger would survive or not based on their features.


Code Explanation

pandas library is used to work with data frames, while numpy is used for numerical computations.

seaborn and matplotlib are used for data visualization purposes.

sklearn library contains machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest Classifier, KNN, Naive Bayes, Perceptron, SGD Classifier, and Decision Tree Classifier.

The Titanic dataset is loaded into the program and cleaned using data analysis and wrangling techniques.

The different machine learning algorithms are applied to the dataset to train the model.

The accuracy of the model is tested on a separate testing dataset.

Finally, the trained model is used to predict whether a new passenger would survive or not based on their features.


Conclusion

This machine learning project is designed to predict whether a passenger aboard the Titanic will survive or not using various algorithms. You can modify the algorithms used and experiment with different data analysis and wrangling techniques to improve the accuracy of the model.
